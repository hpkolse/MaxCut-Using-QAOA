# Solving MaxCut-Using-QAOA

MaxCut is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to partition vertices of a graph into two sets such that the number of edges between two sets is maximized. It is an important combinatorial optimization problem. However, finding the optimal solution to the MaxCut problem is computationally intractable using classical computing methods for large instances of the problem. Hence a quantum algorithm called Quantum Optimization Approximate Algorithm (QAOA) is used to solve the MaxCut problem.
